1) Transactions/bills cannot be issued at times when the given bar is closed

SELECT BL.ID
FROM Bill BL, Bars BR
WHERE BL.BarName == BR.Name AND BL.Time > BR.OpenDateTime AND BL.Time < BR.CloseDateTime

2) Drinkers cannot frequent bars in different state that they live.

SELECT *
FROM Frequents F, Bars B, Drinkers D
WHERE F.BarName = B.BarName AND F.FirstName = D.FirstName AND F.LastName = D.LastName AND D.City = B.City

3)  For every two beers, b1 and b2, different bars may charge differently for b1 and b2 but b1 should either be less expensive than b2 in ALL bars or more expensive than b2 in ALL bars.  Cannot be the case that in one bar Corona is more expensive than Bud and in another Bud is more expensive than Corona.  But Corona may be more expensive than Bud in one bar, and have the same price as Bud in another.

SELECT S1.BarName, S2.BeerName
FROM Sells S1, Sells S2 ON S1.BeerName = S2.BeerName
WHERE (S1.Price <= (
                    SELECT S3.Price
                    FROM Sells S3
                    WHERE S1.BarName != S2.BarName AND S1.BeerName = S3.BeerName
                    ))
      OR (S1.Price >= (
                      SELECT S3.Price
                      FROM Sells S3
                      WHERE S1.BarName != S2.BarName AND S1.BeerName = S3.BeerName
                      ))

4)  Bar cannot sell more beers of specific Brand, than it has in its inventory

SELECT S.BarName, S.ItemName
FROM Stores S
WHERE S.Quantity <
      (
      SELECT sum(B.Quantity)
      FROM Bill B
      WHERE B.BarName = S.BarName AND S.ItemName = B.Item
      )


5)  A bartender cannot work more  than one shift a day.

SELECT *
FROM Shifts S1, Shifts S2
WHERE S1.EmployeeID = S2.EmployeeID AND NOT(S1.StartDateTime = S1.StartDateTime and S1.WeekDay = S2.WeekDay)
GROUP BY Shifts.EmployeeID
